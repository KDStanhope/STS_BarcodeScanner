This is a quick, practical example of the client-side barcode scanner. 

It uses the user's device to access the camera and decode various barcode standards. 

Designed for offline use, the user will "fetch" the list of inventory itmes destined to be scanned, processed and shipped. 

The user will scan stock as it leaves. 

At the end of the day, once the user is back in the office (or anytime they have signal) the results of any scans 
will syncronise with the server.
